# Data Viz project: Fireball Simulation

## What does it do?
Using a database of (most) of the 5th edition dungeons and dragons monsters, this simulates and displays the effects of casting a Fireball spell on a randomly generated group of monsters.

## How do i use it
Using the up n down arrow keys to increase or decrease your level, this affects your Spell Save DC (makes monster less likely to succeed their saving throw against the fireball) and the level at which the wizard is capable of casting the fireball, increasing it's damage.

Use the left and right arrow keys to adjust your intelligence score, this affects your Spell Save DC

Press R to generate new monsters.
Press Space to fire!

## How does a fireball even work
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball
It fires an explosive ball of fire (hence the name) that deals 8d6 points of fire damage to creatures in the area (i.e the sum of eight six-sided die rolls).
Affected creatures  are allowed a dexterity saving throw, by rolling a twenty-sided die and adding their dexterity modifier (determined by their dexterity score). If the amount rolled is equal to or greater than the caster's Spell Save DC, the saving throw is successful, and the creature only takes half damage from the spell.

A higher level spellcaster can cast a fireball at a higher spell level, for every spell level above 3rd (the base level of fireball) the damage increases by 1d6.
